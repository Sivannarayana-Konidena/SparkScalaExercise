# SparkScalaExercise

Data is taken from https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/51280/InternationalBaseline2019-Final.xlsx?v=7838.4, saved data slices into txt files.
I'm not sure on reading xlsx where the data is in the different sequences in the xlsx. Hence data saved into txt files and processed.


code:


Exercise1 is written in Scala :- SparkScalaExercise/src/main/scala/Exercises/Exercise1.scala


Exercise2 is written in Spark - Scala (DF) :- SparkScalaExercise/src/main/scala/Exercises/Exercise2.scala


Exercise2 Output finalData.csv is saved in csv format ('|') sperated.
