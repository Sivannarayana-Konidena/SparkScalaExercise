# SparkScalaExercise

Data is taken from https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/51280/InternationalBaseline2019-Final.xlsx?v=7838.4, saved data slices into txt files.
I'm not sure on reading xlsx where the data is in the different sequences in the xlsx. Hence data saved into txt files and processed.

Exercise1 is written in Scala
Exercise2 is written in Spark - Scala (DF)

finalData.csv is the output saved in csv format ('|') sperated.
